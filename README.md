Scalaz Wrapper for Netty A.K.A. Szetty

#TODO

Setup Project
 + sbt-resolver
 + scalaz8
 + Testing Foundations
 + Documentation Generation

Netty Knowledge
  + decompose packages
  + pick a good place to start

#Notes
  + probably can't use scalaz8 at this point, it might be worth while to start with scalaz7, implement behavior and move components into v8 as they become available
